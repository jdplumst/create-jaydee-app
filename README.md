# Create Jaydee App

This is a Jaydee App. This is a quick way to start up an application with TypeScript. Currently, the only option is for an Express server.

This is a way to start up an appliation using the tools I like to use, including:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## How to Use
- `git clone https://github.com/jdplumst/create-jaydee-app.git`
- `cd create-jaydee-app`
- `npm install -g .`

Then from any directory, you can use the following command to create your own app using one of the templates:
- `create-jaydee-app`

## Credits

A lot of the code I used to create this CLI tool came from [this video from Leo Roese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYko2bHNgVA) and [this video from bonsaiilabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxdSoefSxrA).
